# Pandas is typically used  for working in tabular data(similar to the data stored in a spreadsheet).

# Covid-19 data for Italy in the following formats

# For the numeric columns, you can view some statistical information like mean, standard deviation
# minimum/maximum values and number of non-empty values using  .describe method

# The columns property contains the list of columns within the data frame

# You can also retrieve the number of rows and columns in

# QUERYING AND SORTING ROWS

# Lets say we want to look at the days which had more than
# 1000 reported cases. We can use a boolean expression to
# check which rows satisfy this criterion.

high_new_cases = covid_df.new_cases > 1000
# print(high_new_cases)

# print(covid_df[high_new_cases])
# print(covid_df[high_new_cases]['date']) # If you want to get the dates whose new cases are greater than 1000

# We can write this on a single line by passing the boolean
# expression as an index to the data frame

# high_cases_df = covid_df[covid_df.new_cases > 1000 ]
# high_cases_df

# The data frame contains 72 rows, but only the first 5 and the last 5
# rows are displayed byt default with Jupyter, for brevity.
# To view all the rows, we can modify some display options

# from IPython.display import display
# with pd.option_context('display.max_rows', 100):
#     display(covid_df[covid_df.new_cases > 1000])
    
# We can also formulate more complex queries that involve multiple columns.
# As an example, lets try to determine the days when the ratio
# of cases reported to tests conducted is higher than the overall
# positive_rate

# above_1k = covid_df.new_cases > 1000
# print(above_1k)
# high_cov = covid_df[above_1k]['date'] # or simply .date (this is without the quotation marks)
# print(high_cov)

cases_tests_rate = covid_df.new_cases.sum() / covid_df.new_tests.sum()
# print('The ratio of cases reported to tests conducted is {:.4f}%'.format(cases_tests_rate))

high_ratio_df = covid_df.new_cases / covid_df.new_tests > positive_rate
# print(high_ratio_df)
# print(covid_df[high_ratio_df])

covid_df.new_cases / covid_df.new_tests # This creates a new series.. the daily positive rate or element wise division 

# Further, we can use this series to add a new column to the data frame.

covid_df['positive_rate'] = covid_df.new_cases / covid_df.new_tests
#print(covid_df)

# We can remove the positive_rate column using the drop method

covid_df.drop(columns = ['positive_rate'], inplace = True)
# print(covid_df)
# From the above, when inplace = True, the data is modified in place, which means
# it will return nothing and the dataframe is now updated. 
# When inplace = False, which is the default, then the operation
# is performed and it returns a copy of the object. You 
# then need to save it to something.

# SORTING ROWS USING COLUMN VALUES

# The rows can also be sorted by a specific column using .sort_values.
# Lets sort to identify the days with with the highest number of cases, 
# then chain it with the head method to get the 10 days with the most cases

covid_df.sort_values('new_cases', ascending = False).head(10)

# From the result,it looks like the last weeks of March had the highest number
# of daily cases.
# Lets compare this to the days where the highest number of deaths were recorded
